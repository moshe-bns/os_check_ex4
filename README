REMARKS:


ANSWERS:

1.a. We should add support to the command "leave_group" which will check
 whether the command was written legally (in the format of coammand and name of
 the group) and then write the command to the server which will handle the request. 

 b.Again, add the command "leave group" - then look for such a group in the
 group list and remove the client from that group. We will also check for
 errors: group name which doesn't exist or the client isn't part of this group. 
After removing the client we will check if there is a group with only one client. 
If so we will delete it after announcing the last client that the group is deleted. 
 
2. TCP protocol promises to send the message correctly while UDP doesn't - and
 messages that we send might arrive with mistakes, missing parts or even not
 arrive at all. Whatsapp application is about sending messages from clients and
 this is why our goal is to send the messages correctly - and for this purpose,
 we better use the TCP protocol.

 3. Skype and online-games:  these programs need to send messages in real-time
 and very fast - the UDP is not reliable but work much faster. Even if we lose
 some information it works fast so its the better protocol for this goal. 

 4. It is possible to save all the data that the server holds in a database -
 the server will communicate and manage the data inside the database.
 If and when the server will crash we will be able to connect to the database
 at the next time the server start running and we will get all the information
 we need.
